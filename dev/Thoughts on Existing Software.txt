DriveCalc
##########################
Pros:
-user can hold certain parameters and optimize the others based off of those held
-allows for users to add to component database
-gives weights of components
-simplifies comparison between motors which have been optimized from prop-battery-ESC combination
-can optimize motor for desired thrust

Cons:
-simplistic modelling
-only analyzes static thrust and WOT conditions
-no optimization for a desired weight
-doesn't seem to tie props and motors to get a thrust from a current

ECalc
#########################
Pros:
-allows for selection of entire propulsion unit based off of mission parameters (style, speed, thrust, flight time)
-calculates mixed flight time

Cons:
-must pay for full version (so let's put them out of business :) )
-analysis of optimized propulsion unit not allowed in demo version
-presents quite a large solution space
-only a single mission velocity and thrust can be specified
-they really are tools about the whole demo version thing...
